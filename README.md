**Introduction**



Tested in 10.14.6，now I use opencore as the main bootloader, clover as backup.



Clover setting is based on [LuletterSoul's](https://github.com/LuletterSoul/Dell-XPS-15-9570-macOS-Mojave) repository,  OpenCore is based on [bavariancake's](https://github.com/bavariancake/XPS9570-macOS).



This efi is for XPS15 9570 **4K** with latest BIOS.

i7 8750h

8g * 2 ram

Hynix 1T NVME SSD

4K inner display and one 1080p display through HDMI port or Type-C to DP cable.

Wifi adapter has been replaced with DW1820A.



Touchscreen is blocked in SSDT-I2C.


Everything works well，except FingerPrint and cardreader.
